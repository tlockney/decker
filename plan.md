# Decker Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for the Decker Stream Deck management application, designed to help build the project incrementally with clear, manageable tasks.

## Implementation Stages and Prompts

### Stage 1: Configuration System Foundation

#### Step 1.1: JSON Schema Definition

```text
Create a TypeScript module for the configuration system. Start by defining the TypeScript interfaces that correspond to the JSON configuration structure as specified in the spec.md document.

Implement a simple type hierarchy that covers:
- The overall configuration structure
- Device configuration
- Page configuration
- Button configuration
- Simple action types (placeholder)

Focus on the core structure only, with placeholder types for actions to be expanded later. Use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and code clarity. The schema should validate basic structural properties but defer complex validation for later steps.
```text

#### Step 1.2: Configuration File Loading

```text
Implement functions to load and parse configuration files from the file system. Create a Configuration class that encapsulates this functionality:

1. Add functions to locate and read configuration files from standard locations:
   - User-specified path
   - Default location in user's config directory
   - Current working directory

2. Implement basic error handling for:
   - Missing files
   - Invalid JSON formats
   - Basic structural validation errors

3. Create a simple configuration loading function that returns a typed configuration object or appropriate errors.

All functions should be properly typed using the schema defined in step 1.1.
```text

#### Step 1.3: Configuration Validation

```text
Enhance the configuration system with robust validation. Use a schema validation library like Zod to create validators for the configuration structure.

Implement validators for:
1. Overall configuration structure
2. Device configuration validation
3. Page layout validation
4. Button configuration validation
5. Basic action type validation (placeholder for future expansion)

Validation should:
- Confirm required fields are present
- Verify field types and formats
- Provide detailed error messages for invalid configurations
- Return a properly typed configuration object when valid
- Include helper methods for checking specific elements

The validation should be invoked during configuration loading but separated into its own module for testability.
```text

### Stage 2: Button and State Management

#### Step 2.1: Button State Model

```text
Create a state management system for button states. Implement:

1. A ButtonState class that represents the current state of a button:
   - Visual properties (image path, text, color, etc.)
   - Current action state
   - Associated device and position

2. A StateManager class that tracks:
   - All button states across devices and pages
   - Current active page for each device
   - Methods for getting, setting, and observing state changes

The state system should be observable (use an event system) so that UI components can react to state changes. All state classes should be properly typed according to the schema from Stage 1.
```text

#### Step 2.2: Button Rendering System

```text
Create a RenderingSystem class that handles the visual representation of buttons on Stream Deck devices. This system should:

1. Translate ButtonState objects into visual representations
2. Handle basic text rendering on buttons
3. Support loading and rendering images from files
4. Manage button colors and backgrounds
5. Convert the rendered content into the format expected by the Stream Deck API

Implement image loading, basic text rendering, and color management. The rendering system should be modular and extensible to support more complex visualizations later.
```text

#### Step 2.3: Connecting Rendering to Device State

```text
Connect the button rendering system to the device management layer created previously:

1. Create mechanisms to bind ButtonState objects to physical buttons on devices
2. Implement event listeners for button presses to trigger state changes
3. Set up automated re-rendering when button states change
4. Implement page switching functionality to change visible button sets

The connection should be bidirectional - button presses update state, and state changes update button visuals. Implement proper cleanup for device disconnection and page switching.
```text

### Stage 3: Actions Framework

#### Step 3.1: Action System Foundation

```text
Create the core action system that will execute button functionality:

1. Define an Action interface that all action types will implement
2. Create an ActionRegistry for registering and retrieving action types
3. Implement an ActionExecutor class for running actions and handling their results
4. Define the standard result format for actions

The system should be extensible to allow new action types to be added easily. Implement proper error handling and result processing for all action executions.
```text

#### Step 3.2: Basic Action Types

```text
Implement the first set of action types:

1. LaunchAppAction - Opens an application
2. ExecuteScriptAction - Runs a script or command
3. PageSwitchAction - Changes the active page on a device

Each action type should:
- Have proper TypeScript typing
- Implement the Action interface
- Handle its specific execution logic
- Return standardized results
- Include validation of its configuration
- Be registered with the ActionRegistry

Focus on robustness and proper error handling for each action type.
```text

#### Step 3.3: Action Result Handling

```text
Enhance the action system with comprehensive result handling:

1. Create a standardized ActionResult interface
2. Implement handlers for different result types
3. Add visual feedback based on action results
4. Create a mechanism for updating button state based on results
5. Support transient states for temporary visual feedback

The system should handle success and failure cases appropriately and provide visual feedback to the user through the Stream Deck buttons.
```text

### Stage 4: Integration and Orchestration

#### Step 4.1: Application Integration

```text
Connect all components into a cohesive application:

1. Create a main application class that initializes and manages all subsystems
2. Implement clean startup and shutdown sequences
3. Add proper error handling and recovery at the application level
4. Create a simple CLI for controlling the application
5. Connect the configuration system, device manager, and action system

The integration should follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components.
```text

#### Step 4.2: State Persistence

```text
Implement persistence for application state:

1. Create mechanisms to save and restore:
   - Active pages
   - Button states
   - Action states
   - Global application state
2. Implement auto-saving of state at appropriate intervals
3. Add recovery from persistence failures
4. Ensure clean state reset when configurations change

The persistence should be unobtrusive and maintain the user experience across application restarts.
```text

#### Step 4.3: Error Handling and Logging

```text
Enhance the application with robust error handling and logging:

1. Implement a centralized logging system with configurable levels
2. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
3. Create user-friendly error reporting mechanisms
4. Add telemetry for error diagnosis (optional, with user consent)
5. Implement recovery strategies for common error scenarios

The error handling should be helpful to users while providing sufficient detail for developers to diagnose issues.
```text

### Stage 5: Advanced Features

#### Step 5.1: HTTP Integration

```text
Add HTTP integration for actions:

1. Implement HttpRequestAction for making API calls
2. Add support for different methods, headers, and authentication
3. Create handling for different response types
4. Implement retry and timeout strategies
5. Add appropriate error handling for network issues
```text

#### Step 5.2: Inline Code Execution

```text
Implement the inline code execution feature:

1. Create a secure sandboxed environment for running user code
2. Implement InlineCodeAction for JavaScript execution
3. Create a context with access to relevant state
4. Add proper error handling for user code
5. Implement timeouts and resource limitations
```text

#### Step 5.3: Dynamic Button Appearance

```text
Enhance the button rendering system with dynamic appearance:

1. Add support for state-based images and colors
2. Implement dynamic text rendering based on states and variables
3. Create animation capabilities for button visuals
4. Add support for more complex layouts and visual effects
5. Implement caching for better performance
